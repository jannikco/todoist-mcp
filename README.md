# Todoist MCP server

Triage project tasks and capture an approved follow-up. Read provider data first, then explicitly approve the selected change with operator write opt-in and a unique per-call approval key.

A direct-provider MCP server with useful local execution. No PipMCP account is required for local use. Provider API access and any provider charges are your responsibility.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js22+. Clone this repository, then run:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm test
npm start
```

The default command inspects the tools offline. Configure your own credentials in your environment:

- `TODOIST_API_TOKEN`



Credential help: https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/

## Execute a real read

Replace example record IDs with records you are authorized to access.

```sh
npm start -- --call list_projects '{"limit":10}'
```

## Use with an MCP client

Launch `node /absolute/path/todoist-mcp/server.mjs` using stdio transport; pass credentials through the client environment. Stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC.

## Tools

| Tool | Effect | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| list_projects | Read | List projects. |
| list_tasks | Read | List tasks. |
| create_task | Explicit approval required | Create task. |

## Concrete workflow

Triage project tasks and capture an approved follow-up. Read provider data first, then explicitly approve the selected change with operator write opt-in and a unique per-call approval key.

1. list_projects
2. list_tasks
3. create_task

## Optional writes

Writes are disabled by default. Set CONNECTOR_ALLOW_WRITES=true and supply `_approval: {approved:true,idempotencyKey:"unique-request-id"}` on the specific call. Do not reuse a key for a different request. Uncertain outcomes are never automatically replayed; inspect the provider before another attempt.

## Capability evidence

Local: **Tested — HTTP fixtures and real stdio tools/call**. Managed: **Documented**. Provider authentication and live operations have not been established by these fixture tests. Evidence applies per operation and execution mode; setup discovery does not imply provider execution.

## Managed production

[Activate with PipMCP](https://pipmcp.com/github/start?app=todoist&integration=todoist-mcp&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-todoist-mcp&utm_content=readme) when you want the hosted service.  Local credentials are not uploaded by this code. Review provider permissions in the managed onboarding.
